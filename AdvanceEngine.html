    <h2>Keychain Project Description</h2>
    <p>
      Our first project we made in Advance Engineering class was a keychain with out names on it. We made it in Fusion 360. This was only my second time making something in Fusion so it was challenging at first but I was able to complete it in the end. We then 3D printed them in class.

      <h2>Train Project</h2>
      <p>
        Our second project we made in Advance Engineering class was our train project. Our goal for this project was to each make a train that had an overal theme. My team's theme was Spongebob. I made the Gary the Snail themed car, Aidan made the Patrick Star themed car, Ian made the Kraby Patty themed car, and Tristian made the Kursty Krab themed car. My design process was to  first make the snail body. I sketched out a simple design of the snail body and then used the filet tool to smooth out the edges. Then, I made my second part which was the shell, then made the eyes that will insert into the snail body. The guidelines were that each train car had to have atleast 3 different unique parts so those were my 3. My first major problem was getting the eyes the right size to put into the body. Each time I printed it out, it was either too big or too small. When you modle something in Fusion 360 and it fits together, there is a large chance that it won't fit that same way when you print it out and that is exactly what happened. Another problem was that my screw to screw the shell onto the body was too small and very hard to work with. To fix this, I changed the screw from size M2 to M3 and that fixed it. Another problem was that Mr. Kaiser doesn't have any flat head M3 screws. This is a problem because in order to screw the shell on, the screw needs to be flat so that the wheel body can screw onto the snail body nice and flesh. To fix this problem, I cut out a small cylinder on the snail body to let the oval head screw go into the bdoy. This artificially makes the oval head into a flat head but you would never tell the difference because it is covered by the shell and wheel body.

      <h2>Emobility Project</h2>

      <p>
        For my second semester project in Advanced Engineering, me, Aidan Haynes, and Bella Yoshimura gave a mechanum robot from makeblock a complete makeover from what it was before. Before, all of the components were on the top of the board and the code for the robot did not work. Us as a team redesigned the whole robot and even added another teams robot arm ontop of it at the end. In total, we moved the electronic compnents on the bottom, downloaded the correct code onto a different arduino board, 3d printed a battery box and c bracket holder for emergency off swtch, connect emergecy off swicth to battery box so the fuse wouldn't go out, lazar cut 2 clear boards that fit on the bottom of the robot to protect components, and lazar cut a board to fir the robot arm onto the robot car. The hardest part about this project for me was finding the correct code online and having to figure out that the arduino board we were using was the incorrect one. Overall, this was one of my favorite projects because we actually got to finish it and I had a lot of fun working with my teammates.

      <h2>Lightsaber Project</h2>

      <p>
Another project we did in Advanced Engineering was building our own custom light saber. For this our team was broken down into two groups. One group was the electronics group which was Arron and Ruslan. The other team was the mechanical designing group which was me and Bella. For this project, I was incharge of designing and printing the staff and the bottom and top cap of the lightsaber. In the end, we didn't finish on time but we were able to finish it later so I'm still proud of it. The hardest part of making my shark lightsaber was how intricate and percise my measurments had to be in order to print out the handle correctly.

      <h2>STEAM Outreach Genius Hour</h2>

      <p>
For my genius hour this year, I was apart of the STEAM Outreach club. Our goal for this club was to redesign the car kits that we would take to the elementary schools for them to build. In short, we 3d printed and lazar cut pieces to make the board more sturdy and easiler to build. My part was to help in testing the kits by putting them all together and also cutting the staws for the axles. Then I helped the kids build them when we went to Mary Farmer.
